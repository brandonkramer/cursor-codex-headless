description: "Use Codex to perform delegated implementation, migrations, mechanical edits, structured extraction, fan-out, or clear-spec code work through `codex exec --profile engineer` (default) or `--profile implement` (heavy). MUST invoke when the user asks to hand implementation to Codex/GPT or when parallel/bulk Codex execution is useful."

# Codex Implementation

Delegate code changes from a clear spec. You orchestrate; Codex edits.
